# Dynamic WorkFlow

This is an interactive Process Tree for visualizing a project's workflow and hierarchy. Users can click on nodes to expand their content
and hover over nodes to display a tooltip. Users can also navigate the tree by panning and zooming across the canvas.
Useful as an alternative to using basic flowcharts and diagrams.
